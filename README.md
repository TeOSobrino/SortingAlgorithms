# SortingAlgorithms
Some sorting algorithms that I have coded at my CS class.

All individual codes are in the folder codes, the main, include and source folder are an ADT of sorting algorithms, that can be used in simple C projects
for direct access to sorting algorithms.(further improvement could be implemented in quicksort usnig insertion sort when there are few elements left)
