# SortingAlgorithms
Some sorting algorithms that I have coded at my CS class.

All individual codes are in the folder codes, the ADT folder contains a header and .c that can be used in simple c projects
for simple direct access to sorting algorithms.(further improvement could be implemented in quicksort usnig insertion sort when there are few elements left)
