# SortingAlgorithms
Some sorting algorithms that I have coded at my CS class, heavily based on CLRS.

Individual codes with some portuguese names and comments are in the main branch, all condensed algorithms are in the master branch, in english.
Further improvement could be using insertion sort in mergesort, once there are 5-4 elements in the array, in order to reduce recursive calls
