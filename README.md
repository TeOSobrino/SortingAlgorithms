# SortingAlgorithms
All the sorting algorithms were coded using CLRS as reference.

Individual codes with some portuguese names and comments are in the main branch, all condensed algorithms are in the master branch, in english.
Further improvement could be using insertion sort in mergesort, once there are 5-4 elements in the array, in order to reduce recursive calls

"radix.c" uses base 10, "radix_any_base.c" uses the nearest power of 2.
